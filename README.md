   **Arduino** 
   
Arduino is an open-source platform that helps circuit developers build electronic projects. It consists of both hardware and software. Arduino hardware is a programmable circuit board called a microcontroller. Arduino software is an IDE (integrated development environment) through which developers write and upload the code to the microcontroller. We can feed a program with a set of instructions to the Arduino board that can carry out simple to complex tasks.

   The chip in the Arduino board looks like

   Wire bounds are used to connect QFN-48 Package pins to the boundaries of the chip.

   Components inside the chip

   **Pads** - are something through which we can send signals inside the chip.

   **Core** - is the place where all the digital logic's are placed in the chip.

   **Foundry** - is a place where the chips are manufactured.

   **IP** -  An intellectual property core (IP core) is a functional block of logic or data used to make a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or application-specific integrated circuit for a product.Foundry IPs are used for communication inside the chip.

   **Macros** - Macro Cells are the Memory cells. These IPs have been designed by some other Analog design team, which can be used in the floor plan stage of the design.
